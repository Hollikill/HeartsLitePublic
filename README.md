Some **pair programming** for a [computer science class](https://lasacs.com/)

### How to interpret

**Debug Classes**: Classes with 'Test' in the name , which are classes made only for the purposes of class assignemnts to check that the code is correct

**Base Classes**: The *Deck*, *Card*, and *Player* classes, which are basic frameworks to support the actual design of the game

**Player Classes**: The *CardPlayer* and more complicated *CardPlayerLevel1* classes, which build off of the *Player* class to provide a method to decide what card is best to paly in the moment, based on what is in the player's hand at the moment

**Tournament Classes**: These will pit the computer-controlled players against eachother to see which will come out victorious, but none made so far

**Local Player Classes**: Person-controlled player, none made so far
